## Introduction
Smart Brawl is an AI-driven system designed to analyze **Brawl Stars** gameplay data to predict winrates and optimize strategies. By leveraging **machine learning models** such as **CNN and NLP**, the system provides real-time insights based on player choices, map details, character builds, and rotation strategies. This project aims to enhance player decision-making and performance through data-driven analysis.

## Project Overview
Smart Brawl is a game analytics system focused on **Brawl Stars**. It helps players optimize their gameplay by predicting match outcomes based on selected parameters. The system targets:
- **Casual & Competitive Players**: Improve their game strategies.
- **Esports Teams & Coaches**: Analyze team performance.
- **Game Analysts & Content Creators**: Gain meta insights.

By using **real-time AI-driven predictions**, the system assists players in adapting to the gameâ€™s evolving meta and improving their win rates.

## Objectives
- Develop an AI-based system that predicts winrates based on **character selection, build, rotation, and map**.
- Implement a **recommendation engine** to suggest the best strategies.
- Build a dynamic **frontend (React.js)** for user interaction.
- Deploy a scalable **backend (FastAPI + Firebase/Supabase)** for handling real-time data.
- Host the system on **AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku** for efficient processing.

## Features
- **Winrate Prediction**: AI-based probability calculation for match outcomes.
- **Strategy Recommendations**: Suggested character builds and team compositions.
- **Historical Match Insights**: Past match data analysis for performance tracking.
- **Real-time Processing**: AI adapts to new strategies and gameplay updates.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Interactive UI with visualized analytics.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: Firebase/Supabase
- **Machine Learning**: CNN, NLP models
- **Deployment**: AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Using `npm` (for frontend):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   - Using `pip` (for backend):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. **Run the project:**
   - Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - Run the backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. **Enter match details**: Select characters, build, and map.
2. **Receive AI predictions**: The system calculates winrate probabilities.
3. **View recommendations**: Get suggested lineup adjustments and strategies.
4. **Apply insights in-game**: Use AI-generated recommendations to improve performance.
